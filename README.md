Name of Project: Petabite
===========
Description: Petabite is an online picture database that will meet 
all of the user's adorable animal demands. This platform will allow
any user to upload their own animal pictures, along with the ability 
to tag the picture with the animal/s featured. This tagging service 
will be paired with a revolutionary search engine that will allow the 
user to completely customize what they want to see. Want to see a 
picture with a cat and a bunny? Just search "cat+bunny". Want to see 
all pictures with an animal that starts with the letter 'A? Just search 
"a*"! The robustness of our search and tagging system will be rivaled 
by no other picture-providing service currently on the market.


Technologies:
Bluemix, HTML5, Javascript, CSS, MongoDB, Bootstrap
